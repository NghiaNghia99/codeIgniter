		<p>
			The ScienceMedia Network is able to provide your digital content with a DOI. This allows you to reference on your research content with an unique ID in the web. All interested users can easily follow your DOI and are directed immediately to your papers, presentation, video or posters on the ScienceMedia website. This makes it much easier to find your OpenAccess content in the web!
