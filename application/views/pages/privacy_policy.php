								<p>
									a) Description and scope of data processing We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google". Google Analytics uses so-called cookies. These are text files that are stored on your device and allow an analysis of your website usage. The information about your usage behavior generated by these cookies is transmitted to and stored by Google's US servers. In order to be able to use our website anonymously, we use Google Analytics with the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp". As a result, your IP address is already being reduced by Google within EU member states or other treaty states of the European Economic Area Treaty and therefore anonymised. Only in extreme cases, the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. In no case will your IP address be merged with other data collected by Google. For more detailed information about the Google Analytics terms and conditions and privacy policy, please visit https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/ 6004245?hl=en. For the exceptional cases in which personal data are transferred to the US, Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US- Framework, to ensure an appropriate level of data protection.

								<p>
									Google uses the information to determine how you used the website to provide us with a summary of the website activity and to provide other services related to internet and website usage.

								<p>
									e) Objection and remedy according to Art. 21 DSGVO
								</p>
								<p>
									You are free to prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly
								</p>
								<p>
									For this, Google offers a deactivation add-on for the most popular browsers, which gives you more control over what data Google collects about the website you are visiting. The add-on informs the JavaScript (ga.js) of Google Analytics that no website visit information should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, Google Analytics's opting-out browser add-on does not prevent from information being passed to us or any other web analytics services we may use. For more information about installing the browser add-on, please visit the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
